# Mfon-Nsimah-Volunteer

👋 Hi, I’m Mfon — Data Analyst (SQL | Power BI | Excel | Python)

I focus on practical data analysis for decision-making. My work covers SQL-driven analysis, KPI dashboards, data cleaning, and insight communication using realistic business and social-impact datasets.

📌 What you’ll find here:
- SQL projects answering real business questions
- Power BI dashboards built around KPIs, not visuals
- Data cleaning and validation workflows
- A 4–6 week volunteer data analytics program for NGOs and beginners

🎯 My approach:
Clarify the question → validate the data → analyze → communicate insights clearly.
